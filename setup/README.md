This directory holds the files that I use for my competitive programming setup. Feel free to steal them.

* `template.cpp` is the C++ template that I use for competitive programming
* `cpp.json` contains a VSCode snippet that pastes the whole of `template.cpp` into an empty cpp file with the command `cpp`. If you use spaces instead of tabs, the tabs in the snippet automatically get converted to the appropriate amount of spaces when you use the snippet! *Note*: you should compile your program with a `-DCP_DEBUG_` flag for the `debug` function to work.
* `.bash_aliases` contains g++ compilation aliases I use to compile my programs during a competition.
